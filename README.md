## Project Description

My Weather App is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) Application that fetches weather information from all over the world using the API services from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and [Radar](https://radar.com/documentation).

## Install
```bash
npm install
```
Before starting the application, you must get your own OpenWeatherMap and Radar API keys.
Add those keys as values of the variable **radarKey** at ***src/utils/radarApi.js*** and **api.key** at ***src/utils/weatherApi.js**.

You can also add those keys as environment variables.

## Run
```bash
npm start
```
